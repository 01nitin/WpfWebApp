Port is running on: 5202 
local port URL: http://localhost:5202



Challenges I faced:

1. I initially struggled with establishing a proper connection to the database. After researching online and utilizing resources like Stack Overflow, I learned how to set up the connection using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and create the necessary database..

2. Implementing logging in my application presented its own challenges. I needed to ensure that the logs were created in the specified path with the correct format. I had to troubleshoot issues with the log file not being created and adjusted the file path and logger configuration accordingly. Eventually, I was able to successfully implement logging that captured critical information and errors in my application.


Conclusion:


Despite the challenges, I was able to successfully implement the application with CRUD operations, logging, and API integration. The experience taught me valuable lessons in troubleshooting and problem-solving in ASP.NET Core development.
